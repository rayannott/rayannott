### Events
1. [International Astronautical Congress 2022](https://iac2022.org/ "IAC2022 website") (IAC2022), Paris, France, Sep 2022. 
    - My team presented our research on reinforcement learning for attitude control of a spacecraft with flexible appendages (see [above](#research))
2. [HackaTUM 2022](https://hack.tum.de/ "HackaTUM website"), Munich, Germany, Nov 2022.
    - My team solved the challenge problem of [_Rohde & Schwarz_](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/ "Rohde & Schwarz website") about the microwave imaging technology (see code [here](https://github.com/rayannott/microwave-imaging "WARNING: bad code, just a prototype"))
3. [Ferienakademie 2023](https://www.ferienakademie.de/ "Ferienakademie website"), Sarntal, Italy, Sep 2023. (see the photos [below](#gallery))
    - I participated in the course _"Stochastic Evolution Equations: From martingales to applications"_ by Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Johannes Zimmer and Prof. Dr. Günther Grün (see course description [here](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/math/forschung/gruppen/analysis-and-mathbio/teaching/fa2023/))
    - there I gave a lecture on thermodynamic parametrization of the neural networks based on [this paper](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/fods.2019019)
    - there I also went to many hikes and had a lot of quality time with my fellow students and professors (I hope they take me again next year 😋)
4. [HackaTUM 2023](https://hack.tum.de/ "HackaTUM website"), Munich, Germany, Nov 2023. (see the photos [below](#gallery))
    - My team solved the challenge problem of [_Optiver_](https://www.optiver.com/ "Optiver website") about the market making with sentiment analysis on the news (sadly, I can't share the code because the organizers asked us not to)
